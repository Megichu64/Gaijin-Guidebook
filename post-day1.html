        <h3>October 5</h3>
            <p>It took a 3-hour drive, a 13-hour flight, and a year of impatient waiting—but we were finally en route to Japan. My husband’s best friend had driven down to our house from San Francisco the night before. Since it was his first time in Japan, my husband and I had decided to play the role of “expert” tour guides for our good friend on his first international trip. We had our bags packed and started hauling the items to the car to make our way to LAX. We decided to arrive in LA a day early to break up the travel time. With extra time to spare, we stopped by Randy's Donuts for a late-night bite.</p>

            <p>As excited as we were to embark on our long-awaited Japan trip, we still had to manage sleeping through the night, followed by a long flight before actually setting foot in Japan. This trip was something I had been waiting impatiently for almost a year, so during the wait, I managed to bide my time by planning all the necessities before traveling. If you have a lot of time to plan and save money like I did, this is a great time to tailor-make your very own perfect trip and make sure you don’t forget any <a href="checklist.html">travel essentials.</a></p>
            <p>On top of packing, there are a few other important considerations for ensuring your travel goes as smoothly as possible. First, you might consider purchasing travel insurance. Navigating a foreign country can be challenging, and dealing with a surprise health emergency can further complicate matters. It's a good idea to consider getting travel insurance for your trip to avoid unexpected expenses, especially since most travelers spend 2-3 weeks in the country. Second, it's a good idea to contact your bank before traveling so they are aware that you will be spending money in another country. It's great that banks are monitoring for fraud, but you won't want your card declined after a major shopping haul at Don Quijote.</p>
            <p>Budgeting includes: Flights, hotel, airport overnight parking, travel insurance</p>

        <h3>October 6</h3>
            <p>The day of the flight, I woke up well-rested and ready for travel. We double-checked our luggage and made sure that our paperwork was in an accessible pocket of our personal bags (we used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Melsbrinna-Passport-Waterproof-Wallet%EF%BC%8CID-organizer/dp/B0BYYWD6XH/ref=sr_1_17?crid=165GGZ31M8SLR&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.FVwsMi7YaQVyTFplWYOAyLIIZk-MiBWruy0RqpDRZSDAzBoiFt6MHOJyCKbP1u3fMGTUifJH6O2eWwNybjqVF5T-JhzDbNzDbX-K3oxN2a6GEQfte-_OVvTiq9iHCYe1xUa-EHXjmCsxH-wCRNdlu86wsP4wFN4smDYa9wT8f0YYTRsCkT5UQLITZKpK48iO9ABVEShSnVEr14u7uRFktJsQritXFAoj-i3jxRCj_DdCOvdFY82bOXvzXR7GXOBSb9CL6rPQIkhwRc21c7F8k-zwFP6UiBlFE3yKM443Vt0.7VPgxGLG1Sc_TWpp-jjfnmps3gxupxiOeqRc-QC7SAA&dib_tag=se&keywords=passport%2Bholder&qid=1765343285&sprefix=pass%2Caps%2C218&sr=8-17&th=1">passport holder</a> to keep our IDs, passports, and plane tickets all together for better organization). We layered up in breathable, <a href="checklist.html">plane-ready outfits</a> and slipped on comfortable shoes that were easy enough to pop off through TSA. We were already close to the airport so we could focus on navigating through the international flights section of LAX. We still arrived about 3 hours early, however, because international travel checks can eat up a good amount of time.</p>
            <p>To make travel even more seamless, we had taken care of acquiring global entry to expedite getting through security lines. <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry">Global Entry</a> access requires an application fee ($120 as of 2025), background check, and quick interview, but the payoff is well worth the effort. Having Global Entry speeds up waiting time at the airport exponentially and the Global Entry access lasts 5 years once approved. It's important to give time to get the application processed, because this can take several months, similar to getting your passport.</p>
            <p>Finally, we had made our way through security, boarded the plane, and got as comfortable as possible in our Economy class seats. Looking over to the windows I got to enjoy watching the window transition from the bright sky blue to a dark black tint.</p>
                <img src="images/Blog Photos/window_tinting_animation.webp" class="blog-image-vertical" alt="Time-lapse of airplane window changing from blue to black">
            <p>We had a long journey ahead, and I'm grateful we had planned for <a href="#">flight activities</a> to push through the hours ahead. For us, that meant watching through several movies including our first watch of Knives Out (an INCREDIBLE MOVIE if you haven't watched it by now), tracking the flight animation intermittently, and playing through Pokemon LeafGreen and FireRed. We also frequently made sure to get up several times to stretch our legs out and use the bathroom. When possible, we would try our best to sleep. Occasionally, we would wake up in time for our in-flight meals.</p>

        <h3>October 7</h3>
            <p>At some point the tint of plane windows lightened as we approached Japan. We were given one last flight meal for breakfast and waited for the last remaining several hours to pass. Eventually we got the announcement we had been waiting for as we prepared for landing.</p>
            <em>We were finally in Japan.</em>
                <img src="images/Blog Photos/arrival_in_japan.webp" class="blog-image-vertical" alt="Group of 3 friends at arrival gate in Haneda Airport">
            <p>Still weary from travel, we managed to stumble our way off the plane and push through the long wait of customs. We had already filled out the forms needed to enter the country months through <a href="https://services.digital.go.jp/en/visit-japan-web/">Visit Japan Web</a>. I was dreading customs, but Japan has it down to a science. We scanned our QR codes at a kiosk, showed our passports, and were through the gates in less than 20 minutes. No chaotic lines, no confusion. Then, we skipped getting the JR pass for that year since <a href="transport.html">prices had recently gone up</a> and instead opted for an IC card, which is basically equivalent to a Japan credit card. We used our newly equipped cards to hop on the Tokyo Monorail and wobbled our way to a cozy small hotel in Shinjuku. I don't remember exactly when my head hit the pillow in Shinjuku, but I knew one thing: tomorrow, the real adventure would begin in Tokyo. And we had a packed itinerary awaiting us.</p>

                <p>Typically when you arrive in Japan, the flight attendants will hand you paperwork to fill out for customs. Beat the crowd by using <a href="https://services.digital.go.jp/en/visit-japan-web/">Visit Japan Web</a>.</p>
